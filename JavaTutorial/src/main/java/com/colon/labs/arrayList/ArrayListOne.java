import java.util.ArrayList;

/*ArrayList inherits AbstractList class and implements List interface.
ArrayList is initialized by a size, however the size can increase if collection grows or shrunk if objects are removed from the collection.
Java ArrayList allows us to randomly access the list.
ArrayList can not be used for primitive types, like int, char, etc. We need a wrapper class for such cases (see this for details).
ArrayList in Java can be seen as similar to vector in C++.*/

/*
Constructors in Java ArrayList:

ArrayList(): This constructor is used to build an empty array list
ArrayList(Collection c): This constructor is used to build an array list initialized with the elements from collection c
ArrayList(int capacity): This constructor is used to build an array list with initial capacity being specified*/
